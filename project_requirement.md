# Project Requirements & Fulfillment

This document details how the Gollora project meets and exceeds the requirements outlined in the assignment prompt.

## 1. Design & Implementation Requirements

### Engineering Depth

- **Clean, Modular Architecture:**
  - **Fulfilled:** The project is organized into distinct packages (`cmd`, `internal/agent`, `internal/analyzers`, `internal/models`, `internal/tools`, `internal/utils`). Core components like `ReviewEngine`, `CodeFetcher`, and `ResultAggregator` are decoupled, promoting reusability and maintainability as shown in `architecture_notes.md`.

- **Techniques like AST parsing, agentic design patterns, and RAG:**
  - **Fulfilled (Super Stretch):**
    - **AST Parsing:** Implemented in `internal/tools/ast_tool.go` to enable precise structural queries on Go code.
    - **Agentic Design:** The Q&A agent in `internal/agent/agent.go` uses an AI-powered router (`routeToTool`) to choose between different tools (AST vs. RAG), demonstrating an agentic pattern.
    - **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** The `answerWithRAG` function implements a classic RAG pipeline by fetching relevant code chunks from a vector store to answer general questions.

- **Support Multiple Languages (at least 2):**
  - **Fulfilled:** The system is designed to be language-agnostic and currently has explicit support for **Go** (`internal/analyzers/golang.go`) and **Python** (`internal/analyzers/python_analyzer.go`). Adding new languages is a matter of creating a new analyzer module.

- **Simple CLI Entry Point:**
  - **Fulfilled:** The project provides multiple clear CLI commands via `cmd/main.go`:
    - **Analysis:** `./gollora -analyze -repo-path ...`
    - **Q&A:** `./gollora -qa -repo-path ...`
    - **Server:** `./gollora -server`

### User Experience

- **Comprehensive & Easy-to-Read Reports:**
  - **Fulfilled:** The web UI at `/analyze` presents a dashboard with high-level charts (severity, language, hotspots) and a detailed, well-formatted Markdown report. This provides both a quick summary and deep-dive capability.

- **Natural & Conversational Q&A:**
  - **Fulfilled:** The `/qa` interface is a chat-style application. The agent's use of an LLM to format both RAG and AST tool outputs ensures responses are conversational rather than just raw data dumps.

- **Simple Deployment:**
  - **Fulfilled (Bonus Layer):** The project includes a lightweight web UI. Running `./gollora -server` instantly deploys a fully functional web application on `localhost:8080` with no complex setup required.

### Creativity

- **Extra Credit for Unique, Developer-Valued Features:**
  - **Fulfilled (Super Stretch):**
    - **Automated Severity Scoring:** `cmd/aggregator.go` uses an LLM to re-evaluate the severity of linter-found issues based on code context, providing more intelligent prioritization than static rules.
    - **Dependency Graphs:** `cmd/review_engine.go` parses `go.mod` and `requirements.txt` to generate a Mermaid.js dependency graph, which is rendered in the final report.
    - **Dashboard Visualizations:** The `/analyze` page includes pie charts and a bar chart for "hotspot" files, offering immediate visual insights.

## 2. Deliverables

- **Working Agent (Runnable Locally):**
  - **Fulfilled:** The agent is fully runnable via the Go build process outlined in `README.md`.

- **CLI Interface:**
  - **Fulfilled:** As detailed above, `analyze` and `qa` modes are supported.

- **Support for 2+ Languages:**
  - **Fulfilled:** Go and Python are supported.

- **Deployed Agent (Web/API):**
  - **Fulfilled (Bonus Layer):** A fully-featured web UI is available via the `-server` mode.

- **Code on GitHub:**
  - **Fulfilled:** The code is structured in a clean Git repository.

- **Documentation:**
  - **Fulfilled:**
    - `README.md`: Contains setup, configuration, and usage instructions.
    - `architecture_notes.md`: Contains high-level design decisions and diagrams.
    - `technical_notes.md`: Documents external tools, APIs, and creative features.
    - Feature-specific documentation (`feature_*.md`) provides deep dives into key capabilities.
